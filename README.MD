# E-Commerce Back End

## Activity

- For this activity I created the backend for an ecommerce website. I was able to create a database and populate that database with seeds. Users are able to interact with the database in different ways. They can get, update, delete, and create new products, tags, and categories. 

## User Instructions

- To start please clone down the repo.
- Next, you will need to run "npm i" in the command line to download dependencies.
- Type 'mysql -u root -p' and put in your password for MySQL.
- Once connected type 'create database ecommerce_db;'
- Type quit. This will close the program.
- Next type 'node seeds/index.js'. This will seed the database.
- Finally, to start running the server type in 'npm start'.
- You will now be connected at http://localhost:3001
- Now you are ready to interact with the database. Look in the routes folder to see what routes are set up for you already.
